This is a project I created inspired by the CPI Inflation Calculator presented by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The user can input any given monetary value (such as $471.83) and observe how that value in January 2000 (the start of the 21st century) has changed in the future. Whether that future is relative to the year 2000 or is actually the future is up to the user. The dates span all the way to December 2050. Some of the tools which were utilized for this project include tkinter, GUI applications, and linear regression.
